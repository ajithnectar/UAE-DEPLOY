## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- jdk ( for this program we have used java version 1.8)
- PostgreSQL
- tomcat

# Run Tomcat in docker container
### Tomcat should have credentials 

### Installation and configuration of project
2. Open project folder go to dir : \src\main\resources\docker\application.properties
3. update following field as per you DB credentials

   ```bash
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://your_ip:5432/your_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

# CI/CD Pipeline and Branch Strategy
## Project Branches
### The repository contains 5 main projects, each in its own folder and managed through its own Git branch:
- deployOne
- deployTwo
- deployThree
- deployFour
- deployFive

## Deployment Strategy
### Each project is built and deployed independently.

### Jenkins monitors each branch (deployOne, deployTwo, etc.) for changes.

### When changes are pushed to a branch:

### Jenkins checks out the corresponding project folder.

### Builds the project using Maven.
   ```
     mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -P docker
   ```
### Deploys the generated WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory.

## Once you deploy the project in the webapps folder you can see the tomcat ui all 5 projects are running

# CI/CD Automation Goals
### Isolate build and deployment per project using branch-based workflows.
### Ensure automated and consistent deployment to Tomcat via Jenkins jobs or pipelines.
### Support rollback and environment-specific configurations by managing properties per project folder.
